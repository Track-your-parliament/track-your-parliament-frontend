            The application is based on views summarizing the relevant keywords
            in parliament during a certain period of time in timeline format.
            When the application is first opened the "Per year" view is showed
            initially. By clicking the blue button (shown below) next to the
            year allows you to dig into that year in more detail and show the
            summary of keywords on monthly basis. This same logic applies on
            monthly view where clicking the blue button shows the summary of
            keywords on daily basis. When you are browsing the daily view,
            clicking the blue button allows you the see the individual proposals
            on that day.

          <Typography variant="h5">Using keywords</Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            When you find an interesting keyword in any of the views, by
            clicking it the application shows all the proposals which are
            relevant to that keyword.

          <Typography variant="h5">View the voting data</Typography>
          <Typography variant="body1">
            When you find a proposal that you are interested in, you can press
            the "VOTES" button underneath the summary, or click the bullet next
            to the proposal, to open a window showcasing the voting data of that
            proposal.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            Opening the votes window shows all the voting data available for
            individual proposal. For each vote there are two graphs shown. The
            first graph shows the total distribution of votes between the vote
            options (JAA, EI, TYHJÃ„ and POISSA), and the second graph shows the
            distribution inside every party. Hovering over the charts displays
            details of the chart in a tooltip.

          <Typography variant="body1">
            You can use the search functionality located on the top right corner
            of the application to find individual proposals which contain the
            keyword you are interested. The minimum keyword length to be
            searched is two letters. The results are shown also on a timeline
            format. Clicking on any keyword on the page will also trigger a
            search for that keyword.
